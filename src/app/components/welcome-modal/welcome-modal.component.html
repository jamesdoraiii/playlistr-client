        <p class="md:text-xl leading-relaxed">So happy that you found my website and I hope you like what you see! Just a couple notes before you get started. You are currently accessing an early version of Playlistr. This site is still very much in development. It is likely that you will come across some bugs and issues. I am consistently working to make this website cleaner, more efficient, and feature rich. If you notice a bug that you would like to discuss with me or you have a great idea for a new feature please contact me at jamesdoraiii@gmail.com. I encourage visitors to interact with the website as much as possible! Post a playlist, leave some comments, like a couple playlists. It goes a long way to help the site feel more active and lived in. My only request is that all users keep comments and posts "safe for work". This website is meant to be a part of my portfolio and will likely be viewed when I apply for jobs so I would like for its content to remain appropriate and non offensive.</p>
